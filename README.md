DataVisualization-500MostPowerful
=================================
One of my friends, NM, shared this link: 
http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/04/29/the_500_most_powerful_people_in_the_world

And made this statement: "Interesting list of the world's powerbrokers...can't help but smile to myself.."

So, when I went to the link, I thought, hmm, cool table. But there was no sorting, or filtering and minimal annotation. 
This bookmarklet tries to add some of those features.
I suppose (I haven't done this yet), an overlayed chart of the countries listed and even a bar graph would be even more useful to bring the data to life.

Installation instructions, coming soon.
